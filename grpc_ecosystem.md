# gRPC Ecosystem

The [grpc-ecosystem][] is a GitHub organization that hosts community projects
related to gRPC -- projects include, but are not limited to, gRPC extensions or
integrations, as well as examples that demonstrate how to use gRPC for common or
technically challenging use cases.

## New projects are welcome!

Do you have of a gRPC-related project thatâ€™s a good candidate for the ecosystem? Follow the steps outlined below.

### 1. Requirements

(A) Ensure that your **project** meets the following requirements:

 1. Your project is currently hosted in a public repository (usually, GitHub).
 1. Your project's license is the [Apache license 2.0][license].
 1. Your project doesn't depend on third party libraries with [copyleft][]
    licenses such as [AGPL][] and [GPL].
 1. Your project has a top-level `README.md` with the following information:
    - Project overview
    - How gRPC is used
    - A list of external project dependencies such as third-party libraries
    - Build instructions
    - Automated tests and test instructions

(B) Ensure that all **project contributors** have signed Google's [Contributor
License Agreement][CLA], accepting that all license and patent rights are
determined by the CLA under the [Apache license][license].

### 2. Submit a request form

Once you've addressed all of the requirements listed above, complete and submit
a [gRPC Ecosystem Project Addition Request Form][form].

### Project evaluation

The gRPC team will review your request and evaluate your project.
### Accepted projects

Once the gRPC team approves your request, the team will either create a new repo
for your project, or (temporarily) grant you the permissions necessary for you
to transfer your repo into the [grpc-ecosystem][].
